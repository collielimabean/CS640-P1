Q2:

Expected latency: 
	= 2 * (delay(L1) + delay(L2) + delay(L3))
	= 2 * (40 + 10 + 30)
	= 160 ms


Expected throughput:
	= 20 Mbps (slowest bandwidth)


Average RTT:
h4: 
RTT avg = 160.993 ms

h1: 
RTT avg = 161.042 ms


Average throughput:
h1 (server):
received=55078 KB rate=18.587808479223792 Mbps

h4 (client):
sent=55078 KB rate=20.432367261766753 Mbps
